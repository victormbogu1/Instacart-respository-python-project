## Objective:

I was hired to take on a role of an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Context:

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Folder Contents:

* Data - This folder contains data sets used in the project. Within this folder, I have two additional subfolders: “Original Data”, for storing the raw data sets, which is the original data and “Prepared Data”, for storing any manipulated data sets through python but unfortuanately the prepared data won't be uploaded due to file too large for Github.
* Scripts - Contains step of the process in this project. 
* Analysis - This folder contains all the results I produce throughout your analysis.
* Sent to client - This folder contains all the final deliverables I’ve sent to the client. These includes the latest versions of results I’ve produced.

## Data:

* customers.csv - Contains information about all the customers at Instacart company.
* departments.csv - Contains department names and department_id of all departments from Instacart company
* orders_products__prior.csv - Contains information on re-ordered products from Instacart (file can't be uploaded because is too large on Github)
* orders.csv - Contains order_id, user_id and other relevant information about orders that have been placed with the Instacart app (file can't be uploaded because is too large on Github)
* products.csv - Contains prices of items, product_name, aisle_id, department and product_id, from Instacart company

## Tools:

The following python libraries used for this project were:
* Anaconda - library manager for Python
* Pandas - for data analysis
* Seaborn - for visualizing the data

## Executing code:

Codes executed using jupyter notebooks by 
* Running of codes
* Importing of data
* Generating Crosstabs
